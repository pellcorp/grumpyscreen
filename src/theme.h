//

// that design times the current display scale, so any resolution renders the
// same layout, just larger. At 480x272 all three helpers are identity.
int scale_w(int px);
int scale_h(int px);
// squares and circles follow the tighter axis so they stay round
int scale_r(int px);

// snap to the smallest enabled montserrat (12..28) that fits the scaled size.
// At 480x272 every lookup returns px unchanged; at 800x480 12/14/16/18 land on
// 20/24/26/28, so the size hierarchy survives the trip.
const lv_font_t *scale_font(int px);

// the one spacing token: screen edges, headers, rows, cards. Also the default
// child gap of every row and screen, so nothing needs to set pad_row/pad_column
// unless it wants something other than the standard gap.
int gap();
// the hairline round cards, panels, popouts and entries, in pixels at the
// design size; 0 for none, which is what the classic look wears
int border_w();
// three radii, all derived from one base, so rounding the whole UI off is a
// single number
int radius_sm();  // buttons, swatches
int radius_md();  // cards
int radius_lg();  // panels, popout boxes

// popout boxes span the screen minus one gap on every side, and pad their
// content by a gap and a half (the popout_box style already applies it)
int popout_w();
int popout_max_h();
int popout_pad();
// usable row width inside a popout: box padding, 1px borders, and a little
// headroom so integer rounding can never wrap a full row of tiles. Lay tiles
// out with pad_column = gap() (the popout_box default) and this is exact.

// --- shared styles --------------------------------------------------------
//
// The recurring looks, defined once and shared by every widget that wears one,
// instead of a dozen local style properties per object. Shared styles are
// pointer references; local ones allocate per object, so this is also the
// cheaper of the two at runtime.
//
// Only construction-time looks belong here; anything that changes with state
// (a spool's colour, a button greying out) stays a local style write.
